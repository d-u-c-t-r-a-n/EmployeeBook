# EmployeeBook

This program tries to design a GUI for the nail salons operation.  
Since nail technicians share the revenue with owners, this program aims to create an interface for employees to enter what services they performed, and record into an excel file for the owner bookkepping.  
This program was written in Python because I was familiar with the language, despite the fact that other languages have better performance on designing GUI.  
This program was written without prior knowledge about GUI, and completed after 14 days
